# Tensor-Field
A little experiment turning grayscale maps into tensor fields and traversing them.

## Try it out
`git clone git@github.com:hoqqanen/tensor-field.git`
`cd tensor-field`
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Then open up http://localhost:8000/ 
Click a point on the canvas to place the dot,
click again to make it go in that direction
Click a third time to stop it, and then again to reset
position/angle (or just refresh).
